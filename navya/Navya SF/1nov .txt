Topic: how to plan for long-distance ??

  Hi Deepthi first of all choosing   topic is excellent


1. route destination 2. money 3. vehicle 4. care 5. food 6. accommodation

1. first of all we should plan for the route and destination.

2. coming to the next point we should get a good vehicle ex: a car we have to check whether the conditions of the car are good or bad like engine brakes and all other components.

3. we should carry money or cards for all expenses

4. while traveling we should follow all traffic rules and should carry the documents that we need and follow the GPS incase if we miss the destination for entertainment, we can carry some kits for enjoying.

5. we should carry some food items like snacks any light food 

6. when we reach our destination we must book before the accommodation if overnights arrive we should not get any issues
